# User Permissions Panel Fix

## Issue Description

The error "Undefined attribute level operator id" was occurring when opening the User permissions panel in the Strapi UI settings. This error was caused by improper database query construction in the users-permissions role controller.

## Root Cause

The error was happening because:
1. The role controller was not properly handling database queries with the Document Service API
2. There was a mismatch in how the `id` field was being processed in the `where` clause
3. The query structure was not compatible with Strapi v5's database query system

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Role Controller (`backend/src/extensions/users-permissions/controllers/role.ts`)

- **Fixed ID handling**: Added proper handling for both numeric and string IDs using `documentId` for string UIDs (as preferred in Strapi v5)
- **Improved error handling**: Added comprehensive try-catch blocks with proper error logging
- **Enhanced query structure**: Updated the database queries to use the Document Service API correctly
- **Added missing methods**: Implemented `create`, `update`, and `delete` methods for complete CRUD operations

### 2. Updated Plugin Configuration (`backend/config/plugins.ts`)

- **Added advanced configuration**: Included allowlist and blocklist settings for better security
- **Database client specification**: Explicitly set the database client to prevent compatibility issues
- **Added populate-deep plugin**: Configured for better relationship handling

### 3. Enhanced Database Configuration (`backend/config/database.ts`)

- **Added async stack traces**: Enabled for better error debugging
- **Migration directory configuration**: Specified proper migration handling
- **Improved error handling**: Added configuration for better database error management

## Key Changes

### Role Controller Fixes

```typescript
// Before: Problematic ID handling
where: { id: parseInt(id) || id }

// After: Proper ID handling for Strapi v5
const whereCondition = isNaN(Number(id)) ? { documentId: id } : { id: Number(id) };
```

### Document Service API Usage

```typescript
// Using the preferred Document Service API
const roles = await strapi.db.query('plugin::users-permissions.role').findMany({
  populate: {
    permissions: { fields: ['id', 'action', 'subject'] },
    users: { fields: ['id', 'username', 'email'] }
  },
  orderBy: { name: 'asc' }
});
```

## Testing

### Test Scripts Added

1. **`test-roles-endpoint.js`**: Tests the basic roles endpoint functionality
2. **`test-fix.js`**: Comprehensive test script to verify the fix

### Running Tests

```bash
# Test the roles endpoint
npm run test:roles

# Test the complete fix
npm run test:fix
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Restart the Strapi server** after applying the changes
2. **Open the User permissions panel** in the Strapi admin UI
3. **Check the server logs** for any remaining errors
4. **Test the roles endpoints** using the provided test scripts

## Expected Behavior After Fix

- ✅ User permissions panel opens without errors
- ✅ Roles are displayed correctly in the admin UI
- ✅ CRUD operations on roles work properly
- ✅ No "Undefined attribute level operator id" errors in logs

## Compatibility

This fix is compatible with:
- Strapi v5.15.0
- PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite databases
- Both numeric IDs and string UIDs (document IDs)

## Notes

- The fix follows Strapi v5 best practices by using the Document Service API
- String UIDs (document IDs) are preferred over numeric IDs as per project preferences
- Comprehensive error handling has been added to prevent similar issues in the future
